	<h1>Hello, I'm Bryan! Welcome to my Data Science blog.</h1>
	<p>I love data and using it to make lives better.
		<br>
		I help people to better understand others and the world around them, using storytelling & data visualization as powerful tools. I help everyone who is willing to change their perception of others & their perception of things that they thought they knew. Those I help become more compassionate and make better decisions.

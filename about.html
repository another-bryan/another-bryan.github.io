			<h1>About Another Bryan</h1>
			<p>This is a brief bio here. I went to this school, I studied that thing, I now work in data science with research interests in understanding fellow humans and improving operational efficiencies. At my previous position at a place, I worked on some stuff. I could list some significant accomplishments, awards, or recognition here as well, but isn't LinkedIn for that? I live in a city with other people. In my free time I like to be outside, to write code for my side projects.</p>

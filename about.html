			<h1>About Bryan C (another-bryan)</h1>
			<p>This is a brief bio here. 
				I have a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering, and a Masters in Business Administration with an emphasis in Marketing.
				I now work as a data scientist with research interests in understanding consumer/employee behavior and in improving operational efficiencies. 
				In my previous positions, I worked on some stuff. I could list some significant accomplishments, awards, or recognition here as well, but isn't LinkedIn for that? 
				I live with my family in a place with other people. 
				In my free time I like to be outside, and to write code for my side projects.</p>

			<h1>About Bryan C (another-bryan)</h1>
			<p>This is a brief bio here. 
				I help people to better understand others and the world around them, using storytelling & data visualization as powerful tools. 
				I help everyone who is willing to change their perception of others & their perception of things that they thought they knew. 
				Those I help become more compassionate and make better decisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering, and a Masters in Business Administration with an emphasis in Marketing.
				I now work as a data scientist with research interests in understanding consumer/employee behavior and in improving operational efficiencies. 
				In my free time I like to be outside, and to write code for my side projects.</p>
